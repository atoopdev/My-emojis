Quick review project to cement topics from previous sections.

Goal: Create a simple web interface that lists my three favorite emojis and that also allows new emojis to be added/removed from the beginning/ends of the list.

Modifications: After completing the assignment I went through and consolidated the addTo and removeFrom functionality into two functions (instead of using duplicate code underneath each event listener.)
